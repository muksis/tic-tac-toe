# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description

A tic-tac-toe game built using React. 

## Roadmap of future improvements

Add two input fields to let the players add their names or leave Player X/Player O by default. This will reqire value and onChange attributes and the useState hook.\
Add a New Game button that resets the squares when the status says that there is a winner. It will require gameState tracking if I understand it correctly.
